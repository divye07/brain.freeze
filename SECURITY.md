# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policy for the Secure Voting System, a project developed for the **Google Developers Group Solution Challenge 2025** contest by team Brain.freeze().

## 🛡️ Our Commitment to Security

The Secure Voting System was designed with security as its foundational principle. As a verification system for democratic processes, we understand the critical importance of maintaining the highest security standards to protect voter data and ensure the integrity of the verification process.

## 🔄 Supported Versions

The following versions of the Secure Voting System are currently receiving security updates:

| Version | Support Status | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Active | Current release for GDG Solution Challenge 2025 |
| 0.9.x   | ✅ Active | Beta release with essential security features |
| < 0.9.0 | ❌ Unsupported | Development versions, not for production use |

## 🔍 Security Features

Our project implements multiple layers of security to protect user data and ensure system integrity:

1. **Biometric Authentication**
   - Face recognition using TensorFlow.js and face-api.js
   - Multiple angle face template storage for increased security
   - No persistent storage of raw biometric data

2. **Document Verification**
   - AI-powered ID card validation using Google Gemini API
   - Cross-reference verification against authorized voter database

3. **Data Protection**
   - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
   - Secure local storage with encryption
   - Pseudonymization of voter data where possible

4. **Application Security**
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)
   - Regular dependency audits and updates

5. **Future Firebase Implementation**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Firestore security rules
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Audit logging for all sensitive operations

## 🚨 Reporting a Security Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### How to Report a Vulnerability

1. **Email**: Send details of the vulnerability to `security@brain-freeze-team.com`
2. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggestions for mitigation

### Response Process

The Brain.freeze() team follows these steps when handling security reports:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
2. **Assessment**: Our security team will investigate and validate the reported issue.
3. **Updates**: We will provide regular updates about our progress (at least every 7 days).
4. **Resolution**: Once resolved, we will notify you and publish an advisory if necessary.

## 🔒 Security Measures for GDG Solution Challenge 2025

For the Google Developers Group Solution Challenge 2025, we have implemented additional security measures:

1. **Containerized Deployment**: Ensures isolation and consistent execution environments
2. **Regular Security Scans**: Automated vulnerability scanning with GitHub's Dependabot
3. **Identity Verification Segregation**: Strict separation between verification system and actual voting
4. **Minimal Data Collection**: Only collecting the data necessary for verification purposes
5. **Transparent Security Architecture**: Open for review by GDG judges and community

## 📋 Compliance and Standards

Our development process adheres to industry best practices:

- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability awareness and prevention
- GDPR compliance for personal data protection
- Election commission security guidelines for voter verification

## 🤝 Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will work with security researchers to verify and address any reported vulnerabilities. We promise not to take legal action against researchers who follow responsible disclosure practices.
